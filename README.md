# Text-RPG-prototype
this is a C++ file that generates a C++ map using the terminal, all game mechanics are entirely logic made 

Instructions:
In order to play the user must select the options presented to him
once in the map, you can use WASD to move around and you must return to the origin position and press "S" to go back to the main menu
the rest of the functions are very intuitive
